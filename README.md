# Svelte + Vite

Now with dark theme btw :D

[Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) is a compiler that generates minimal and highly optimized JavaScript code from our sources Rich Harris. and [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is a no bundler DEV environment created by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803). 

By using a super fast svelte without VDOM plus the vite project that I made this can run fast, stable and according to my expectations
